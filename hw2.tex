\subsection*{(a)}

We aim to find $\mathbb{P}(X \in \{3, 4, 5\})$ with $X \sim \text{Poisson}(2)$, or the probability that $X$ is 3, 4, or 5 within the Poisson distribution with $\lambda = 2$. To do this, we can find the respective pdfs and sum them up: \\
$\mathbb{P}(X = 3) = 0.18044704$ \\
$\mathbb{P}(X = 4) = 0.09022352$ \\
$\mathbb{P}(X = 5) = 0.03608941$ \\ 
$\mathbb{P}(X \in \{3, 4, 5\}) = 0.18044704 + 0.09022352 + 0.03608941 = $ \framebox[1.1\width]{\textbf{0.30675997}}

\subsection*{(b)}

We aim to find $\mathbb{P}(Z < -4)$ with $Z \sim \text{N}(0, 1)$. This is the default normal, and we essentially just need to take the cdf of -4, which we can look up / calculate in R to be \framebox[1.1\width]{\textbf{3.167124e-05}}

\subsection*{(c)}

% check and see if this is right for sd_nu adjustment or not
$\mathbb{P}(T / a < -4)$ with $T \sim \text{t}(10)$ and $a = 1.25$; that is, $T$ has a Student's $t$ distribution with 10 degrees of freedom. Again, we take the cdf of -4, which we can look up / calculate in R to be \framebox[1.1\width]{\textbf{0.001259166}}.

\subsection*{(d)}

The quantities calculated in (b) and (c) are known as the probabilities of a 4-sigma event. Suppose that $Z$ and $T/a$ are the log returns of two different assets. Briefly comment on how much more likely 4-sigma events are for $T/a$ compared to $Z$ and what this reveals about these asset returns. \\ \\
The likelihood of a 4-sigma event, where the log returns are 4 standard deviations below the current value, is much more likely for the heavy-tailed distribution based asset than the normal distribution based asset.

We model the one-day log return for a stock is $t_{t+1} \sim N(0.0006, 0.02^2)$, and the current investment $P_t = \$ 10$ million.

\subsection*{(a)}

We aim to find the value $x$ such that the probability that the investor suffers a one-day log return less than $x$ is $1\%$. Essentially, we want to find $\mathbb{P}(X < x) = 0.01$. We can do this by using the quantile function using the normal as described; calculating this using R we can find this log return value to be \framebox[1.1\width]{\textbf{-0.04592696}}


\subsection*{(b)}

We aim to find the 99\% value-at-risk, which we can do by calculating $-(P_{t+1} - P_t)$. We first calculate $P_{t+1}$. We know log returns is calculated such that \\
$-0.04592696 = \text{ln}(\frac{P_{t+1}}{P_t})$ \\
$e^{-0.04592696} = \frac{P_{t+1}}{P_t}$ \\ 
$e^{-0.04592696} = \frac{P_{t+1}}{10 \text{ million}}$ \\ 
$P_{t+1} = 9.551117 \text{ million}$ \\ \\
$99\% \text{ VAR} = -(P_{t+1} - P_t) = -(9.551117 - 10) \text{ million} = 0.448883 \text{ million} = $ \framebox[1.1\width]{\textbf{\$448,883}}

\section*{3.}

Let \textbf{X} = $(X_1, X_2 \sim \text{N}(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \Sigma))$ be a bivariate normal distribution, where \\

$\boldsymbol{\mu} = $
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
2	
\end{pmatrix}, 
$\Sigma=$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & -1.2 \\
-1.2 & 2
\end{pmatrix}.

\subsection*{(a)}

Explain why $\Sigma$ is a valid covariance matrix.

\subsection*{(b)}

If $X_1$ and $X_2$ are the one-period log returns of two consecutive periods, explain what $X_1 + X_2$ represents, and find the distribution of $X_1 + X_2$.
