\subsection*{(a)}

$\mathbb{P}(X \in \{3, 4, 5\})$ with $X \sim \text{Poisson}(2)$.

\subsection*{(b)}

$\mathbb{P}(Z < -4)$ with $Z \sim \text{N}(0, 1)$.

\subsection*{(c)}

$\mathbb{P}(T / a < -4)$ with $T \sim \text{t}(10)$ and $a = 1.25$.

\subsection*{(d)}

The quantities calculated in (b) and (c) are known as the probabilities of a 4-sigma event. Suppose that $Z$ and $T/a$ are the log returns of two different assets. Briefly comment on how much more likely 4-sigma events are for $T/a$ compared to $Z$ and what this reveals about these asset returns.

\section*{2.}
{\Large

Suppose the one-day log return for a stock is $t_{t+1} \sim N(0.0006, 0.02^2)$. At the current time, an investor has $P_t = \$ 10$ million invested in the stock.  

\subsection*{(a)}

Find the value $x$ such that the probability that the investor suffers a one-day log return less than $x$ is $1\%$.

\subsection*{(b)}

The $99\%$ value-at-risk is the value such that the probability the investor incurs a greater one-day loss is $1\%$, that is, $-(P_{t+1} - P_t)$, where $P_{t+1}$ is the value of the investment if the one-day log return $x$ were to happen. Find the $99\%$ value-at-risk.

\section*{3.}
{\Large 

Let \textbf{X} = $(X_1, X_2 \sim \text{N}(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \Sigma))$ be a bivariate normal distribution, where \\

$\boldsymbol{\mu} = $
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
2	
\end{pmatrix}, 
$\Sigma=$
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & -1.2 \\
-1.2 & 2
\end{pmatrix}.

\subsection*{(a)}

Explain why $\Sigma$ is a valid covariance matrix.

\subsection*{(b)}

If $X_1$ and $X_2$ are the one-period log returns of two consecutive periods, explain what $X_1 + X_2$ represents, and find the distribution of $X_1 + X_2$.
