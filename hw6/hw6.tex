\subsection*{(a)}

We implement this in R. One value that is generated is \\
\framebox[1.1\width]{\textbf{Estimate: 0.6739545}}

\subsection*{(b)}

We implement this in R. The bootstrap statistics are \\
\framebox[1.1\width]{\textbf{Estimate: 0.6687307}} \\
\framebox[1.1\width]{\textbf{Bias: 6.870455e-05}} \\
\framebox[1.1\width]{\textbf{Std. error: 0.01524621}}

\subsection*{(c)}

We plot in R, and the distribution does seem to be approximately normal, with slightly lower tails than the normal distribution line:

\subsection*{(d)}

We implement this in R, and get the following values: \\ 
\framebox[1.1\width]{\textbf{Normal 95\% CI: ( 0.6388,  0.6985 )}} \\ 
\framebox[1.1\width]{\textbf{Percentile 95\% CI: ( 0.6379,  0.6976 )}}

\subsection*{(e)}

We can calculate the approximate 95\% confidence interval for $\hat{\rho}$ as given, with the fact that $n = 3626$ and $\hat{\rho} = 0.6687307$ as we find using R: \\
$(\hat{\rho} - 1.96 \frac{1 - \hat{\rho}^2}{\sqrt{n}}, \hat{\rho} + 1.96 \frac{1 - \hat{\rho}^2}{\sqrt{n}})$ \\
= $(0.6687307 - 1.96 \cdot \frac{1 - 0.6687307^2}{\sqrt{3626}}, 0.6687307 + 1.96 \cdot \frac{1 - 0.6687307^2}{\sqrt{3626}})$ \\
= $(0.6687307 - 1.96 \cdot \frac{1 - 0.44720074912}{\sqrt{3626}}, 0.6687307 + 1.96 \cdot \frac{1 - 0.44720074912}{\sqrt{3626}})$ \\
= $(0.6687307 - 1.96 \cdot \frac{0.55279925088}{\sqrt{3626}}, 0.6687307 + 1.96 \cdot \frac{0.55279925088}{\sqrt{3626}})$ \\
= $(0.6687307 - 1.96 \cdot 0.00918022965, 0.6687307 + 1.96 \cdot 0.00918022965)$ \\
= $(0.6687307 - 0.01799325011, 0.6687307 + 0.01799325011)$ \\
= $(0.65073744989, 0.68672395011)$ \\
This approximate 95\% confidence interval seems to be relatively close, but much smaller and thus more refined than both of the confidence intervals that we previously found. In this case, it seems that this calculated 95\% confidence interval is the most refined and therefore the most appropriate in this situation.

\subsection*{(a)}

We calculate and plot this using R, and it seems that the distribution is approximately normal, although a tiny bit off:

\subsection*{(b)}

See R file for the implementation: \\

\end{verbatim}

\subsection*{(c)}

See R file for specific implementation. I achieved the following results. From these results, it seems that they were all pretty similar, weith the BCa having the largest confidence interval, followed by the percentile and normal, which were extremely close. The percentile tended to have lower quantile values than the BCa, and the normal had even lower values than the percentile. \\ \\ 
\begin{verbatim}
  print(ci.normal)
  [1]  71.42664 128.66163
  > print(ci.percent)
  [1]  72.89518 130.05975
  > print(ci.bca)
  [1]  75.85013 135.36732
\end{verbatim}
