\subsection*{(a)}

To calculate the daily arithmetic returns, we take the adjusted stock prices for each day $n$ and simply calculate the daily returns like so: \\
$R(t_{n-1}, t_n) = \frac{{P_t}_n - P_t_{n-1}}{{P_t}_{n-1}}$ \\
Which we then plot.

\subsection*{(b)}

To calculate the monthly log returns, we take each time period $n$ and evaluate like so: \\
$r(t_{n-1}, t_n) = \text{log}\frac{{P_t}_{n}}{{P_t}_{n-1}}$ \\
which evaluated to the following results: \\

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}

	\textbf{Month} & \textbf{Return} \\

Suppose an investor has a portfolio of Microsoft and Apple stock. Use the Microsoft prices from Question 1 and obtain the Apple prices in a similar way. The investment period is 2021-01-04 to 2021-08-31 as before. The proportion of the portfolio invested in the Microsoft stock is 60\% at the start of the period. On 2021-05-03, the investor rebalances the portfolio so that the proportion invested in Apple stock is 60\%. Find the arithmetic and log return at the end of the period.

Consider the following situations. \\
An asset has a 20\% return in the first month and a -20\% return in the second month.
An asset has a -20\% return in the first month and a 20\% return in the second month.
Which situation is better for an investor in the asset if the returns are arithmetic returns? What if they were log returns? Explain your answer.
